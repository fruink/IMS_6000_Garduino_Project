Garduino School Project

Objective:

Working in groups to create an automated garden/plant monitoring system using an Arduino micro controller, moisture sensor, and the Johnny-Five Library.
The data that will be outputted from the sensor will be read and graphed on a page using chart.js and Johnny Five library. The graphed data will display the plants moisture, water level measurement, feeding, and will also be trying to have an voice recognition feature based on research we will conduct as a group.
